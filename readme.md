### My journey
**"Building the Future, One Line of Code at a Time!"** - This motto fuels my enthusiasm as a full-stack engineer. I thrive on creating, building, and designing products from scratch, with a strong focus on delivering exceptional user experiences through seamless UI/UX design.

In my college years, my journey began by leading a team in various small-scale projects, gaining valuable project management experience, and sharpening my skills. I then ventured into the realm of elderly care solutions, where I validated problem statements with 50+ individuals, built an MVP, and conducted tests to address their needs. Although the outcome fell short of my expectations, this experience taught me resilience and the importance of validating ideas, ultimately propelling me into the world of design and web development. [Have compiled all the docs related to the journey here](https://github.com/themohammadsa/eMars) üîç.

Driven by my love for design, I transitioned to the design field, exploring various disciplines such as graphic design and web UIs. However, I felt a void that led me to take the leap into web development. This transition has been incredibly rewarding, allowing me to create beautiful and functional designs that come to life through my technical skills and a keen eye for design.

Fast forward to now, I am an active contributor to open-source software, I currently maintain [responsively-app](https://github.com/responsively-org), an exciting project - a modified web browser that helps in responsive web development. Professionally, I work as a *software engineer* at [HatchXR](https://kids.hatchxr.com/) - a gamified platform for educating children of all ages to code with blocks (read 3D for scratch)
